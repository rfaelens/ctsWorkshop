# ctsWorkshop
A presentation in R Markdown to teach the basics of clinical trial simulation.

## Outline / short summary
Modeling & simulation has become an essential part of the clinical development of any new drug. During clinical trials, data is collected to describe the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a compound. This is modeled using non-linear mixed effects models. This course focuses on answering drug development questions using an NLME model.In 4 hours, we show a structured approach to simulation: from single parameter simulations, into simulation of populations, simulation of a clinical trial, and finally clinical trial optimization.

## Learning objectives
- Students will know what impact NLME simulations have in drug development
- Students will understand how drug development takes variability into account
- Students will understand the distinction between population simulation and clinical trial simulation
- Students will know what type of simulations is appropriate to answer specific questions in drug development

## Pre-requisites
This course assumes some familiarity with basic concepts of non-linear mixed effects models: structural model, residual error, inter-individual variability, and covariate modeling.
